# 🌡️ Global Temperature Anomaly Analysis

This project analyzes global average temperature anomalies from **January 1850 to the present** using monthly data obtained from the **NOAA** (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). The goal is to evaluate how global temperatures have changed over the past 170+ years.

## 📄 Dataset Description

The dataset is located in the `temp_anomalies.csv` file and contains two columns:

- **Date (YYYYMM)**: A six-digit date indicating the year and month (e.g., `185001` for January 1850).
- **Anomaly (°C)**: The global temperature anomaly in degrees Celsius, defined as the deviation from the 1901–2000 average temperature.

> A **positive anomaly** indicates a warmer month than the long-term average, while a **negative anomaly** indicates a cooler month.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `temp_anomalies.csv`: csv file which contains data describing global average temperature anomolies for each month of the years 1850 to this year.
- `global_temp_vis.py`: script that contains all commands
